# learning_python
I am learning Python using the **Jupyter** Notebook and the **Spyder** IDE. I have been using **R** for about a year and I now feel comfortable enough with it to venture into enemy territory. I hear too much about Python to not be curious. In addition, I do a fair amount of string processing and web scraping, and Python definitely seems to have a better reputation in those areas.
